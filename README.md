<h1 align="center">C++ Console App (Trade System)</h1>
<h3 align="center">I made a console application in this project, whose purpose is to first create a membership in the transaction system to be used and then log in to that membership. If the login is successful, it will allow us to make transactions. If the login fails, it will ask you to log in again. On the transaction screen, each product has its own code and you can buy the product you want by using these codes. If you give up purchasing the product, it will redirect you to the product purchase screen.</h3>
